Anyone who wishes to constribute feel free, this is an  *as is* project for now. It is incomplete since I am working on something more..interesting lets say.
there is still lots such as translations, games and overall improvement of the code needed.
I have taken insiration from other sources, and this was mainly a *me* messing around with c# and getting used to the language a little.
I am working on as a hobby Ai and voice cloning, it would be my desire to create an inbuilt OS AI based on Kurisu from Steins;gate this would involve use of pytorch, and virtual environments and the like for Tensor-RRT and deepspeed features
Including an AI voice and model respective to said emotions and so forth, clips of the characters voice can be extracted from the anime, then from those we can use XTTS, Rvc or eleven labs to recreate the missing subtitles for the Vn novel in English using AI, from there we have a diverse set of audios in a Json file.
Thats the basics of it anyways.
